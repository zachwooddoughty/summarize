Not all of them have been winners, but somewhere amongst the unfinished albums and misguided t-shirt ideas there are some real design gems.
Today, 24 of Kickstarter’s best designs will go on sale at the MoMA Store.
These are the kinds of products that look so good and perform so well they rise above the crowdsourced masses. It’s the ultimate nod of approval: A crowdfunded design getting shelf time at a design institution.
To narrow the field, MoMA Store curators scoured Kickstarter for interesting projects.
“The filters we used in selecting the Kickstarter projects were the same we always use in seeking good design,” says Chay Costello, Assistant Director of Merchandising for MoMA .
