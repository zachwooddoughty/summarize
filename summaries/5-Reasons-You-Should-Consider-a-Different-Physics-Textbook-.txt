I think you should consider switching from your current introductory physics textbook to Matter and Interactions (by Chabay and Sherwood – published by Wiley).
Matter and Interactions is a calculus-based, first-year physics curriculum.
It’s not just any ordinary physics textbook.
Maybe you found a first edition of Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday and Resnick (first published in 1960).
But students use the textbook (at least they are supposed to), and not the faculty, right?
