Two Pro-Level Blenders for the Demanding Smoothie Specialist 


Long considered the king of Blender Hill, Vitamix’s luxe model packs enough brawn to pulverize just about anything—from ice cubes to celery stalks to handfuls of chard— with ease. It draws 2.2 peak horsepower at 1,200 watts, spinning 24,000 rpm at full blast. The Vitamix has a friendly side too: It’s relatively quiet considering its power and capabilities, and the tough 2-quart con- tainer pops on and off easily. It’s the pick for a simple blender that looks reasonably nice, though it grinds away a chunk of your pay- check along with your pineapples.

The Ninja distinguishes itself with an attachment that runs down the center of its 72-ounce container. Here two additional pairs of blades grind stuff in the center—not just at the bottom—of the carafe, doing the job faster and more completely than the Vitamix. The 2.5-peak-horsepower 1,500- watt motor is very loud (think vacuum cleaner) and so powerful at full 24,000- rpm throttle that the base has suction cups to help keep it on the counter. Looks-wise it’s a bit homely, but at half the price of the Vitamix, perhaps just as lovable.
