Watch: World’s Fastest Motorcycle Is So Smart, Even Rookies Can Master It 

The Ducati 1199 Panigale R is the fastest motorcycle in the world. But what makes it amazing isn’t its 1,200cc, 195 horsepower engine, its carbon fiber bodywork or its track-tuned suspension (though all of that helps). What makes this bike so amazing is the computer-controlled engine management system. The bike is almost completely controlled by wire and packed full of sensors, so almost anyone can ride it like a pro–or at least select a mode that adapts this thrill-ride to your skill level.
Want proof? Our own Damon Lavrinc took one out on the track–and made it back alive. Check it out.
