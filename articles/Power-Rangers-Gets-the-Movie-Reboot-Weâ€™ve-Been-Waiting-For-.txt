Power Rangers Gets the Movie Reboot We’ve Been Waiting For 


Proving that no childhood icon is safe from the forces of Hollywood, the (Mighty Morphin’) Power Rangers are now set to follow in the footsteps of the Transformers, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and GI Joe and get their own big-screen reboot. 
In a statement released today, Lionsgate and Power Rangers owners Saban Brands revealed the partnership, with Power Rangers creator Haim Saban saying that Lionsgate is “the perfect home for elevating our Power Rangers brand to the next level,” referencing the studio’s The Hunger Games, Divergent and Twilight franchises as proof.
Power Rangers are “the perfect brand with which to create a motion picture event that will resonate with moviegoers around the world for years to come,” Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer said in the statement, suggesting that the studio is already looking at building a big franchise out of the kids’ series that has run, almost uninterrupted, for the last 21 years.
This won’t be the first big-screen outing for the franchise; Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers: The Movie was released in 1995 in an attempt to capitalize on the craze surrounding the series’ first incarnation, with Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie following two years later to launch the series’ third incarnation. (Pity poor Power Rangers Zeo, which came in between and didn’t get its time in the cinema sun.)
Between this announcement and this summer’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, it’s clear that the childhood nostalgia craze amongst Hollywood executives has reached the early 1990s. Should Turtles be a hit when it’s released this August, we can only hope that the official announcement of a Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? reboot is quickly forthcoming.
