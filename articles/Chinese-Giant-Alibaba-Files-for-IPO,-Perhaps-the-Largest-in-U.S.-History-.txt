Chinese Giant Alibaba Files for IPO, Perhaps the Largest in U.S. History 


Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has filed to go public here in the U.S., setting the stage what could be the largest Wall Street debut in history.
In its 250-page filing with federal regulators, Alibaba did not say how much it intends to raise with its initial public offering. But according to one report, the company is looking to sell a 12 percent stake for between $15 billion and $20 billion. That means the IPO could eclipse Visa’s $18 billion debut in 2008, the largest on record, and Facebook’s $16 billion success, the second largest. It would also give Alibaba a $168 billion market cap, making it smaller than Apple and Google but larger than Facebook, Amazon, and eBay.
That’s not an unwarranted number. Alibaba is among the top three internet operations in China, the world’s second largest economy. According to its filing, the company pulled in $5.6 billion in revenue and $1.4 billion in profit last year. Gross sales from its three largest sites — Taobao (similar to Amazon), Tmall (similar to eBay), and Juhuasuan (group buying) — totaled $248 billion. And nearly 20 percent of its business comes from mobile devices, which means it oversees about 76 percent of China’s mobile e-commerce in China.
The company claims 231 million active buyers and 8 million active sellers across all its sites, and it’s growing at a rapid clip. Revenue spiked 72 percent last year, according to today’s filing.
If the IPO meets expectations, it could revive Wall Street’s appetite for tech offerings. According to reports, at least two internet IPOs were delayed in the last month — one for enterprise storage firm Box, and another for mobile payment startup Square — amid declines in existing tech stocks. But the Alibaba IPO holds particular interest for Yahoo. The American web giant holds 24 percent of the company and may be forced to sell half of that as the company goes public.
Alibaba has not chosen between the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. Nor has it begun the all-important “roadshow,” where it would provide additional information to institutional investors. And questions remain over risks related to politics and organized crime in China. China is still, in many ways, uncertain territory for the American business world. But that may be changing.
