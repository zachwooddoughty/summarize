Watch the Ultimate Mashup of Game of Thrones and Super Mario 


For everyone who ever dreamt of a world where Daenerys Targaryen would just hop on one of her dragons and ride through Westeros like she was Mario atop Yoshi, today is your lucky day: Someone has recreated the Game of Thrones opening sequence so that it happens in Super Mario World. 
The video combines the building-of-Westeros style of the HBO show’s opening titles with the super lush colors of the Super Nintendo game to animate the classic videogame’s overworld maps. Trees grow, castles are erected, and crowns are adorned with Yoshi and his quick-grab tongue. There’s even an 8-bit version of the theme song. It’s fantastic.   
Check out the clip above. Then enjoy spending the rest of your day trying to stop imagining a world where Mario is on the Iron Throne and Princess Toadstool-as-Cersei is sitting nearby drinking her umpteenth glass of wine.
