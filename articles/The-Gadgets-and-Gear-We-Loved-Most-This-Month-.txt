The Gadgets and Gear We Loved Most This Month 



View the gallery in full screen to read more about the things we loved in April.
One of the best parts of our jobs here at WIRED is that we get to test all the new things as soon as they come out. But we often only get a few days to play with something before having to write about it. That can be difficult–getting a clear assessment of an object’s worth when you have to crank out a written review in less than a week. Some products only show their true colors after several weeks, months, or years to experience them, live with them, play with them, and wear them. That’s what we’ve rounded up here–things we’ve been testing and love, or the stuff from our lives that we own and never want to let go. This is the gear we want to take everywhere. This is the stuff we want to cook breakfast for. These are the things we love.
