McLaren’s Hybrid Supercar Will Get an Even More Super Track Version 


The hybrid McLaren P1 appears on anyone’s short list of wonderfully excessive supercars, with just over 900 horsepower and mind-bending acceleration coupled with exquisite handling. But too much is never enough for some people, which is why McLaren is said to be considering an even more potent version for track use.
There’s nothing official, but word has it that McLaren is quietly contacting the 375 people lucky (and affluent) enough to own a P1 to gauge interest in a track-ready version. Top Gear cites an unnamed McLaren insider saying there are plans for such a car, which would have “more power, more torque and more body, too.” Other sources say the number of cars will be in the “low double digits” and production will only begin after all 375 P1s have rolled off the assembly line.
That said, such a machine will almost certainly sport a more potent version of the 3.8-liter twin turbo V8 and electric motor combo that produces 903 horsepower in the current P1. You’ll probably see aerodynamic mods designed to improve handling, and a spartan interior with little more than a seat, safety equipment and the bare minimum needed to get the car around a track in as little time as possible. Not that the P1 is any slouch in that department–the car hits 62 mph from a standstill in 2.8 seconds, tops out at 217 mph and is, in the words of AutoWeek, “astonishingly fast on the track.”
The car will only be available to current P1 owners, who get access to exclusive track days and mentoring from professional drivers who can show you just what the car can do.
