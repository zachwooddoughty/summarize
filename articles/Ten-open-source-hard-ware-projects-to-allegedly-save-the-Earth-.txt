Ten open source hard ware projects to allegedly save the Earth 

“As Alastair Parvin of WikiHouse put it:
”   “This increased access to knowledge is hugely important…it acts as the foundational infrastructure on which we can start to build a whole new economy.”
*Hey, I’m radically in favor of knowing how to do stuff.  If you lack access to knowledge, obviously you can’t do much.  I’d even be willing to try out living in a real, existent Wikihouse.  I know I’d get some plywood splinters, but I wouldn’t mind a bit.
*However, there’s a colossal distance between knowing how to do something and the mass adaptation of that knowledge as an everyday part of our ethical, legal and social culture worldwide. That’s quite like the difference between knowing how to kiss, and feeding, clothing and sheltering a family of ten.
*Open Source is always promising to build a “whole new economy.” There’s a rather well-established open-source economy nowadays that’s neither whole nor new.  Why keep saying this?  It’s like promising Zen enlightenment without knowing that you still have to chop wood and carry water.
*The genuinely new development in Open Source is an open resistance to open-source by established power players.  What’s especially new and different is the bitter, politicized, statehouse and working-class resistance to commercial Big Sharing efforts such as Uber and AirBnB.  Distributing access to knowledge isn’t gonna be the problem any more — politics is gonna be the problem.
*The days when you could break-open system and have that seen as some harmless desktop hobby for leftie eccentrics with modems — those days are fading fast.  Instead of being seen as Maid Marian the techie intellectual in Sherwood Forest, you’re increasingly likely to get stingingly denounced as a moonbat exploiter.
*In the meantime, though, you really should check out that open-source hardware car.  Hey, I’ve been inside one of those.  You can bolt it together in no-time flat and it’s like a steel dune-buggy.  I hope you don’t kill yourself driving it, I also hope that you can somehow get it to pass legal inspection in your locality.  
*As for cars somehow saving the Earth, well, look at a thermometer sometime.
