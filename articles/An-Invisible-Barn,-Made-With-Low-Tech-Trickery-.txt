An Invisible Barn, Made With Low-Tech Trickery 



If you’re looking to hide a barn in plain sight, here’s a fool-proof way to go about: cover it in mylar. That’s what New York City architecture firm stpmj did for a new conceptual project for the Architectural League’s Folly Competition.
The contest asks up and coming designers to create a 21st century architectural folly to be installed in the Socrates Sculpture Park in Queens, N.Y. Derived from the French word for “foolish,” a folly is a building or structure that’s created with no real purpose beyond looking cool.
These sorts of architectural novelties can be obnoxiously obvious, but stpmj’s Invisible Barn was designed to disappear altogether. The simple structure is made from two-by-fours covered in mylar, the shiny material found in silvery birthday balloons and space blankets. The mirrored surface reflects its surroundings; in this case, the sky, some plants and a wooded grove.
A few strategically placed cut-outs amplify the illusion, creating floating windows that peer into the scenery you’re already experiencing. It’s a trippy optical illusion, particularly when you realize you can walk through the passageways like a door. By turning the building into an apparition, the focus is shifted from the man-made structure back to the natural world.
Its technique is reminiscent of the mirrored-covered shack in Joshua Tree, or the glassy modern treehouse from Gluck+ that sits above the canopy in upstate New York. And though the Invisible Barn didn’t win the competition, we’re hoping this doesn’t mean the concept will actually disappear.
