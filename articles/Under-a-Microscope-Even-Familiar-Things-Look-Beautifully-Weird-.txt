Under a Microscope Even Familiar Things Look Beautifully Weird 



On a microscopic scale, a four-day-old zebrafish embryo looks a lot like a multicolored alien wearing enormous headphones and looking surprised. Or maybe it’s just in the middle of singing along with “Happy” or whatever the aliens are streaming these days through their headphones (which are actually the zebrafish’s eyes). On a similar scale, the crystals on a solar cell look like a chaotic foreign landscape. Zoom in even more, and human cardiac tissue resembles a knobby, moss-covered tree trunk.
These and the other images collected here are the winners of the 2014 Wellcome Image Awards, which celebrate striking science and medical images. The overall winner depicts a mechanical heart pump embedded in the chest of a patient awaiting a heart transplant. Constructed from a new type of CT scan, the full image is rendered in 3-D and can be rotated, sliced, and magnified.
