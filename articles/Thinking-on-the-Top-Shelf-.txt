Thinking on the Top Shelf 


Hi.
I wrote a book. It’s about the science inside the human relationship with alcohol—making it, drinking it, and feeling it the morning after.
But I was interested in booze well before I wrote the book. Ever since I was old enough to watch my grandmother mix a Gibson, or my great grandfather drink a tiny glass of Galliano before bed, I’ve wondered what that stuff was, why it smelled so interesting, and how come it came in such beautiful bottles. Why did James Bond order a Martini but Philip Marlowe ordered a Gimlet with a half-dash of bitters? And what was bitters?
The only way I’ve ever understood the world around me is through science. I have a little training in it—I’ve spent some time breaking glassware in labs. Really, I’m a reporter. But my inclination is to look to the scientific method to understand the universe.
That’s what this blog is going to be about. I’ll share some of what I learned for the book—with some stuff that I didn’t include. And unlike the book, I’ll be giving some of my impressions of drinks and bars, and maybe even a little bit of my own life in the kitchen, standing in front of homemade ginger beer or a shaker full of ice, wondering what to pour in next.
I want to hear from you, of course, too. What are you drinking? And why?
Anyway, that’s what we’re going to be doing here for the duration. I hope it’ll be fun. And now, as they used to say at the end of goodbye parties at Newsweek in the old days: The bar is open.
