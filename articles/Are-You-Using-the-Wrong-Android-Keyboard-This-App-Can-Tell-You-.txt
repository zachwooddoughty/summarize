Are You Using the Wrong Android Keyboard? This App Can Tell You 


Among Android’s many customizable perks is the number of different keyboards you can choose from for your device. Some users already have strong preferences, but for those who don’t, there’s a new app to help you decide.
Typist includes 10 different typing tests to determine a) how fast of a mobile typist you are and b) what your typing style is. Tests run between one and three minutes long, and finish with charts displaying your results. These include your speed in words per minute, total number of errors, and the letters you most frequently mistype. You can also compare yourself to others on the app’s leaderboards if you’re gunning for one of those world’s fastest typist titles. Similarly, if you want to track your abilities over time, you can see a history of your progress.
But perhaps what’s most useful about this app is that it supports multiple keyboard layouts, so once you’ve taken these typing tests, you can identify which keyboard format you type fastest (and most accurately) on. Of course if you already have a strong keyboard preference, you can use the app to simply become a better mobile typist on it too.
