Cross-Platform Java Malware
(January 29, 2014)
Researchers have found Java-based malware that is capable of infecting
Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux systems. The malware exploits a known flaw
in Java 7 u21 and earlier for which Oracle released a patch in June
2013. The malware communicates with an Internet relay chat channel that
serves as a command-and-control server. The network of computers
compromised by this malware is used to launch distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

[Editor's Note (Ullrich): Not only does this malware run on different
operating systems, but it is also smart enough to add itself as an
auto-start program on each operating system.]
