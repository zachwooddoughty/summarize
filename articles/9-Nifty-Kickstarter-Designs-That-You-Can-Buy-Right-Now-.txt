9 Nifty Kickstarter Designs That You Can Buy Right Now 



Since Kickstarter launched in 2009, more than 61,000 projects have been funded and brought to life. Not all of them have been winners, but somewhere amongst the unfinished albums and misguided t-shirt ideas there are some real design gems.
Today, 24 of Kickstarter’s best designs will go on sale at the MoMA Store. These are the kinds of products that look so good and perform so well they rise above the crowdsourced masses. It’s the ultimate nod of approval: A crowdfunded design getting shelf time at a design institution.
To narrow the field, MoMA Store curators scoured Kickstarter for interesting projects. “The filters we used in selecting the Kickstarter projects were the same we always use in seeking good design,” says Chay Costello, Assistant Director of Merchandising for MoMA . “Does this design solve a problem?” We’ve picked out nine of our favorites from the list. All of them will be on sale until June 16 at both MoMA Store locations in New York City.
