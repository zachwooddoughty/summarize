Check Out Early Storyboards From the Original Star Wars Trilogy 


Sure, everyone gets excited about May the Fourth. A whole day dedicated to celebrating all things Star Wars? Sign us up! But the days after always feel a little empty. So this year, it’s time to keep the party going until May 6—the Revenge of the Sixth. (Too soon?) The wordplay may not be as good, but we’ve got a little something to make the day super special: the teaser for Star Wars Storyboards: The Original Trilogy, out May 13. The book is chock-full of rare illustrations for early versions of George Lucas’ story, many of which never made it to the big screen. Check out the video above for a peek at what A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi looked like way back when.
