Small but Mighty Charger Juices Tablets and Jump-Starts Cars 


Like Bluetooth speakers, a flood of portable gadget chargers gets released into the world every week. But with the exception of their color schemes and current specs–1-amp chargers for phones, 2-amp chargers for iPads and other tablets–they all do pretty much the same thing.   
Not the Juno Power Jumpr. This blue brick may look like a lot of other chargers out there, but it’s powerful enough to juice up your phone, tablet…or car. 
Yes, in a pinch you can use the Jumpr to jump-start your auto. The 6000 mAh, cell-phone-sized charger is capable of delivering a 12-volt, 300-amp output from a dedicated port. It comes with a jumper-cable attachment, and the cable has a built-in chip designed to prevent reverse charging of the Jumpr’s lithium-polymer cell. According to Juno Power, the Jumpr should work with four- and six-cylinder engines, but its 300-amp output may not be enough to turn over a V8.
For charging gadgets with the Jumpr, you use an entirely different port. It has a separate micro USB connector that delivers a 2-amp output for all your phone-, tablet-, and camera-charging needs. It won’t recharge a laptop, though.
Despite the Jumpr’s superpowers, it’s in the same price range as your average non-car-jumping portable charger. Until May 1st, it costs $70 as part of a pre-sale promotion. It’ll go for $90 thereafter.
