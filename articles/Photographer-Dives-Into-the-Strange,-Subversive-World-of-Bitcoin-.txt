Photographer Dives Into the Strange, Subversive World of Bitcoin 



A photo project about bitcoin is a terrible idea, because there’s so little to see. The currency is purely digital, and relatively few people use it. But that didn’t stop Los Angeles photographer Megan Miller from somehow bringing bitcoin to life in her photos.
“The idea came to me because I really just wanted to figure out bitcoin for myself,” Miller says.
Some of the first pictures she made are exactly what you’d expect if you know anything about bitcoin: stuff you can buy with bitcoin. For example, Miller met a pot dealer on Craigslist who accepts the currency and photographed his stash, but not his face.
“Basically at first the easiest thing to photograph was the stuff that people are purchasing with bitcoin,” she says.  
Early on she found a guy with a necklace fashioned from bitcoins made by Mike Caldwell and his Casascius Coins mint. The coins themselves aren’t legal tender, of course; they store the private cryptography key that lets you spend or transfer your bitcoins.
“Those kinds of photos are what people often associate with the currency, but I knew there was more,” Miller says. She’s since made portraits of bitcoin aficionados who have embraced the currency, and those working to improve bitcoin infrastructure and security.
The project is by no means an encyclopedic look at bitcoin, but instead a snapshot documenting a moment in the currency’s history.
“My real interest lies in seeing what happens,” she says.
