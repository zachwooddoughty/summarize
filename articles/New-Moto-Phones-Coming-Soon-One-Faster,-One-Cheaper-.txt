New Moto Phones Coming Soon: One Faster, One Cheaper 


Few “budget” smartphones are any good. But one that’s impressed just about everybody is the Moto G from Motorola. It has good hardware and it runs the latest version of Android with a minimal skin. We gave it one of our highest ratings when we reviewed it last year, and, thanks to its low price (under $200 unlocked worldwide), it went on to be Motorola’s best-selling handset.
But it was only 3G. It didn’t have LTE like the Moto X, the iPhone, the Galaxy, or any other top-tier device. That was the one bummer on an otherwise excellent phone.
Today, Motorola has confirmed a Moto G with LTE is on the way. It will cost a little more: $220, which is still very reasonable for an unlocked phone, and you’ll still be able to buy the 3G version for $180. The new 4G-capable Moto G also gets a microSD card slot, making it even more attractive for the price.
Also coming soon is an even lower-priced version called the Moto E. It will reportedly be a bare-bones version of the same handset with lesser internals (a dual-core instead of quad-core processor, for one), and it will sell for a downright cheap $130. So now there are three Motos to choose from, all fairly priced, and with enough variation across the three models to appeal to customers in emerging and established markets.
These phones should hit retail in late May. Motorola is announcing the new models at a series of press events around the world. We’ll be attending the U.S. event later today, where we’ll learn more details and get our hands on some hardware.
