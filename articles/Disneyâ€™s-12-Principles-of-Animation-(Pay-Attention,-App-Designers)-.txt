Disney’s 12 Principles of Animation (Pay Attention, App Designers) 


New mediums give birth to new rules. In the case of animation, the grammar was codified by figures like Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, who explored the burgeoning artform’s possibilities at Walt Disney Studios starting in the 1930s. Thomas and Johnston, two of Disney’s “nine old men,” outlined the tenets their team settled upon in Illusion of Life, published in 1981. Here, you can see those twelve basic rules in charming animated form.
The clip, created by Italian illustrator Cento Lodigiani, helps us understand these principles by applying them to a supremely simple subject: a cube. Squashing and stretching, we learn, can “give the illusion of weight and volume to a character as it moves.” The principle of “follow through and overlap” dictates that a character’s body parts continue to move when they stop running–think Wile E. Coyote’s neck stretching out like a rubber band when he screeches to a halt.
Of course, rules are meant to be broken, and today’s animated films continue to push the art form into all new territory. Still, to appreciate those innovative transgressions, it helps to know what was in the rulebook in the first place. Plus, as designer Khoi Vinh points out, with animation becoming ever more fertile territory for app designers to explore, this crash course comes right on time.
