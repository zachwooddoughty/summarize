395-Horsepower VW Golf Is Pure, Wonderful Excess 



The Volkswagen GTi always has been a sensible, versatile hatchback with the soul of a sports car. It essentially created the “hot hatch” segment, and the GTi long has been an enthusiast’s car with occasional and delightful high-performance variations.
Like, for example, the Golf R 400 appearing at the Shanghai Auto Show. It’s an absolute beast capable of embarrassing some of the finest cars from Germany and Italy. Put us down for one–if VW decides to actually build it.
The 400 refers to its claimed output, 400 pferdestärke, which translates to about 395 horsepower. All that power comes from a beefed-up and highly pressurized version of the 2.0-liter turbocharged four-banger you’ll find in the Golf R. Think about that for a moment. If VW isn’t fudging the numbers (the car is a concept, after all), that’s almost 200 horsepower per liter. To put that in perspective, the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport is good for 150.
Fitted with a six-speed DSG and all-wheel-drive system, the 3,130-pound hatchback needs just 3.9 seconds to hit 62 mph from a standstill and has a (governed) top speed of 174 mph. Wheeee!
The bodywork hints at the lunacy within. The body is 40 mm wider than the Golf R, with flared wheel arches that call to mind the Rallye Golf of 1988. A carbon fiber splitter and wide air intakes in the bumper direct cooling air to the engine compartment, while twin pipes at the rear expel the exhaust. Nineteen-inch wheels, track-ready seats and a few square yards of Alcantara add to the racy vibe.
At this point, the R 400 is a concept, a “what if” along the lines of that crazy 12-cylinder Golf that VW unleashed in 2007. Too often, wickedly awesome concepts never see production. Here’s hoping VW sees the light and builds the R 400.
