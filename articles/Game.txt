Game


Laura Hudson and I discuss the merits of the PlayStation Vita and its new, slimmed-down iteration that Sony shipped in the U.S. this week, on today’s Game|Life podcast.
We also get into Nintendo’s new Skylandersy interactive figurine business, and the question of same-sex marriage in its upcoming game Tomodachi Life. (We recorded this podcast before Nintendo issued its latest statement on the matter.)
Game|Life’s podcast is posted on Fridays, is available on iTunes, can be downloaded directly and is embedded below.
