Gadget Lab Podcast: Facebook’s Killing It as Twitter Lags Behind 


Big week at Facebook. The company showed off some new tools for app-makers at F8, its yearly developer conference. There wasn’t too much for consumers to get directly excited about, but the back-end tweaks Facebook is making — newer frictionless authentication options, and a change in the way apps inter-link with one another — are sure to make apps dependent on Facebook easier and more pleasant to use, regardless of whether the users immediately grasp why. Mat and Mike discuss the ever-expanding hug-fest that is Facebook, a company that can seem to do no wrong lately. Twitter, on the other hand, is stumbling. It reported slowing growth numbers this week, and the boys speculate as to why fewer people are biting. Also, the hosts say both nice things and complainy things about Snapchat’s latest changes and the CyanogenPhone. At the end of the show, Mike tells a boring story about being the annoying guy trying to take pictures with his iPhone while real life happens all around him.
